# Usercentric - Project - Monkees

In this project I was asked to build a website for the 60's rock music band with a great experience of peforming live on different events and around the world.     

## UX

This website target audiences are their fans who wish to listen music and watch videos of the band.  For this purpose there are pages MUSIC and VIDEOS are included.  The MUSIC page is introducing some of the albums and allowing to listen to single hits in mp3 format.
The VIDEOS page contains video in mp4 format and embeded YouTube videos. The BAND page introduces band and its members.

Also the website allows the band to publicise their availability to perform on different events. There is a CONTACT page with a form to fill in for people who interested to invite the band to perform on their occasions.

The website is fully responsive and can be used on devices with different screen sizes and in all browsers.

Wireframes have been created in Balsamiq and can be viewed [here](wireframes/)
